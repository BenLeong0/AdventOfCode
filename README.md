# AdventOfCode

### These are my solutions for the algorithm based projects hosted at https://adventofcode.com/, from the 2020 series.

If you are working through these problems yourself, it is highly advised that you do not look at problems that you have not completed yet yourself. The point of the questions is to practise working through problems of this kind, and viewing others' solutions entirely takes away from this. As it says on the ProjectEuler website:
> If you photocopy a crossword solution then what have you achieved?
