### These are my solutions for the algorithm-based, Christmas-themed question sets hosted at https://adventofcode.com/

## Languages / Challenges

In 2020 (my first year of coding), I apparently tried to tackle the problems in the least readable way possible.

In 2022, I tackled the problems in two ways:

- Python, with solutions that could be formatted on a single line only (in an attempt to one-up my 2022 approach).
- Google Sheets, which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A1Gg2brEQIeIbRuvaOpOqgJ3lJ19s8L64MnsKQafbJI/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

In 2025, I again attempted to tackle the problems with oneline-solutions only.
